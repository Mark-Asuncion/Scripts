<p>Ryomen Sukuna, more often called just Sukuna, is an extremely powerful Cursed Spirit that serves as one of the primary antagonists of Jujutsu Kaisen.
<br><br>
Known as the undisputed King of Curses, Sukuna, according to legend, 
was a demon (though in truth was a human Sorcerer)
during the prime era of Sorcery 1000 years ago,
and Sorcerers gave their all to defeat him. After his death, 
his corpse was unable to be fully destroyed, and thenceforth his remains of 20 fingers, 
preserved in grave wax, traversed the ages as Cursed Objects.[1] In the present, 
Sukuna has incarnated into Yuji Itadori due to the latter eating one of his cursed fingers,
which contain his fragmented power.</p>
